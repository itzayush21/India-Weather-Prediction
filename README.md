## Project Description: Weather Predictor
Created with CodeSandbox

The Weather Predictor is a web application designed to allow users to input various weather-related data and get a detailed report based on their inputs. The application is particularly useful for understanding current weather conditions by taking into account several parameters such as temperature, wind speed, pressure, precipitation, humidity, cloud coverage, feels-like temperature, and visibility. The primary aim of the Weather Predictor is to provide users with a comprehensive overview of the weather in a specific state.

This project provides a practical and user-friendly solution for weather prediction and is a demonstration of the seamless integration of front-end and back-end technologies using Flask and Bootstrap. The project is structured to be scalable and easily extendable for future enhancements or additional features.
